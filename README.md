# VisualOn HTML5+ Player Project Setup and Demos


## Prerequisite
Please refer to Tools/setuphttpserver/Win32/README.txt or Tools/setuphttpserver/MacOS/README.md to check how to setup a HTTP
server and run the player demo. 

If your server tops on MacOS or Linux, you need change the permission of code files by command "sudo chmod +x files".

## Quick start for developers
Create a div element in your HTML first. Please make sure the controls attribute is present.
```html
<div id="container"></div>
```
Add player and ui sdk to the end of the body.
```html
<head>
  ...
  <!-- Player SDK -->
  <script src="yourPathOfLibs/voplayer.min.js"></script>
  <!-- UI SDK -->
  <link href="yourPathOfLibs/voplayer-ui.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
  <script src="yourPathOfLibs/voplayer-ui.min.js"></script>
</head>
```
Now comes to good stuff, we need to create a voplayer and UI to initialize your player..
```js
   var divVideoPlayer = document.getElementById("container");
   // build player
   var player = new voPlayer.Player(divVideoPlayer);
   player.init(config);
   // attach ui engine
   playerUI_ = new voPlayer.UIEngine(player_);
   playerUI_.buildUI();
   // load stream
   player.open(source);
   player.play();
```
When it is all done, it should look like the following code.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div>
      <div id="container"></div>
    </div>
    <script src="libs/voplayer.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      var container = document.getElementById("container");
      
      // build player
      var player = new voPlayer.Player(container);
      var config = {
          // Please ask AE for an valid client key.
          key: '',
          playback: {
            autoPlay: true
          }
      };
      player.init(config);
      
      // attach ui engine
      playerUI_ = new voPlayer.UIEngine(player_);
      playerUI_.buildUI();
      
      var source = {
        links: [{
            uri: "http://dash.edgesuite.net/akamai/bbb_30fps/bbb_30fps.mpd",
            type: "dash"
        }]
      };
      player.open(source);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
## Guide for configuring player and source
Users can initialize the player with a configuration and open the media source with sourceConfig. 

For the sample code, player configuration and sourceConfig are in "common/assets/assets.js".

"common_config" is player configuration, you must set a valid license key for it.

"DRM_stream_wv" "Webvtt_Thumbnail_stream" "Low_latency_stream" ... are sourceConfig
