# VisualOn HTML5+ Player Project Setup and Demos


## Prerequisite
Please refer to Tools/setuphttpserver/Win32/README.txt or Tools/setuphttpserver/MacOS/README.md to check how to setup an HTTP
server and run the player demo.


## Quick start for developers
Create a div element in your HTML first. Please make sure the controls attribute is present.
```html
<div id="container"></div>
```
Add voplayer.min.js to the end of the body.
```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="yourPathOfLibs/voplayer.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
Now comes to good stuff, we need to create a MediaPlayer & initialize it.
```js
   var divVideoPlayer = document.getElementById("container");
   var player = new voPlayer.Player(divVideoPlayer);
   player.init(config);
   player.open(source);
   player.play();
```
When it is all done, it should look like the following code.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div>
      <div id="container"></div>
    </div>
    <script src="libs/voplayer.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      var container = document.getElementById("container");
      var player = new voPlayer.Player(container);
      var config = {
          // Please ask AE for an valid client key.
          key: '',
          playback: {
            autoPlay: true
          }
      };
      player.init(config);
      var source = {
        links: [{
            uri: "http://dash.edgesuite.net/akamai/bbb_30fps/bbb_30fps.mpd",
            type: "dash"
        }]
      };
      player.open(source);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
## Guide for configuring player and source
Users can initialize the player with a configuration and open the media source with sourceConfig. 

For the sample code, users can modify "voDefaultConfig" and "voDefaultStream" in "SamplePlayer/sampleplayer/app/assets.js"
to set their own configuration and default stream. Also, users can add streams to "voAvailableStreams" in
"SamplePlayer/sampleplayer/app/assets.js".

If the media source does not have a complex configuration, users can input the URL and related DRM information 
by selecting "Enter Asset" from the drop-down menu of "stream" in the Demo.
